# netmd-exploits

## What is it?
`netmd-exploits` is a library aiming to store all the available exploits for Sony NetMD devices.

## What exploits are available?

The exploits currently available are:

|    Exploit name    | Firmware Versions* compatible |  JavaScript class name  |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Firmware Dumping   |     All versions supported    |      FirmwareDumper     |
| USB Code Execution |             B1.600            |     USBCodeExecution    |
| Tetris             |             B1.600            |         Tetris          |
| Force TOC Flushing |             B1.600            |      ForcedTOCEdit      |
| Atrac Dumping      |             B1.600            | CachedSectorAtracRipper |

*The firmware versions listed here consist of the SOC type letter:

- A - CXD2677
- B - CXD2678 / CXD2680

And the actual firmware version reported by the device.

### Examples

|        Unit        |    SoC    |  Firmware version  |  netmd-exploits firmware version  |
|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
|    Sony MZ-N510    |  CXD2680  |       1.600        |               B1.600              |
|    Sony MZ-N710    |  CXD2680  |       1.600        |               B1.600              |
|    Sony MZ-N1      |  CXD2677  |       1.200        |               A1.200              |
|    Sony MZ-N10     |  CXD2678  |       1.200        |               B1.300              |

## Hacking
If you would like to help with adding compatibility for your device, pull requests are welcome.

### An exploit's structure
The library keeps track of what exploits are compatible with what versions with the help of `src/compatibility.ts`.
Every exploit class has to inherit the `Exploit` abstract class. It provides multiple functions which make it easier to load the correct versions of exploits for every firmware version.
The constants that depend on the firmware version are stored in a `VersionStore` map returned from `getPropertyStore()`, from which it's possible to get values by calling `getProperty`, or by referencing their names in assembly code, prefixed with a '$'. Every exploit class has to also define a `static _name` const, used for compatibility checking.

### The inbuilt assembler
The assembler has full support for macros (prefixed with '@'), `VerstionStore` constants (prefixed with '$'), as well as variables, passed to the `assemble` function (prefixed with '%').

The macros available for every assembly program are stored in `src/assembler/core-macros.ts`.

Happy hacking!
